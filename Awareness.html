        A child dies from hunger every 10 seconds
Poor nutrition and hunger is responsible for the death of 3.1 million
 children a year. Thatâ€™s nearly half of all deaths in children under the age of 5.
  The children die because their bodies lack basic nutrients.

Globally, 822 million people suffer from undernourishment.
There is more than enough food produced in the world to feed everyone on the planet
. Yet as many as 828 million people still go hungry.According to the USDA, there is a strong connection
 between hunger and chronic diseases like high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.
